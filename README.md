  - **BrowserUtils**: Helper methods for browser interactions.
  - **ConfigurationReader**: Reads configuration properties.
  - **Driver**: Manages WebDriver instance.
  - **logger**: Contains classes for logging test results.
    - **log.java**: Manages logging of test actions.
    - **TestResult.java**: Handles test result logging.
- **pages**: Contains page object classes representing web pages.
  - **CuraPage**: Elements and methods for the Cura website.
  - **AmazonPage**: Elements and methods for the Amazon website.
- **tests**: Contains test classes for various scenarios.
  - **BaseTest**: Base class for common test setup and teardown methods.
  - **CuraTest**: Test cases for the Cura website.
  - **AmazonTest**: Test cases for the Amazon website.

## Test Scenarios

### CuraTest

- **loginSuccessTest**:
  - Navigates to the Cura website.
  - Attempts a successful login using valid credentials.
  - Asserts that the user is redirected to the appointment page.

  - Attempts login without a password.
  - Asserts that the login button is still displayed, indicating a failed login.

- **loginFailedWithoutUserName**:
  - Navigates to the Cura website.
  - Attempts login without a username.
  - Asserts that the login button is still displayed, indicating a failed login.

### AmazonTest

- **task**:
  - Navigates to the Amazon Turkey website.
  - Accepts cookies on the homepage.
  - Searches for "Bilgisayar".
  - Selects the first product from the results.
  - Adds the product to the cart.
  - Navigates to the cart and removes the item.
  - Asserts that the cart is empty by checking for the "Amazon sepetiniz bo≈ü." message.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that the WebDriver is configured correctly.
2. Set up your configuration properties in the `ConfigurationReader`.
3. Execute the tests using JUnit5 in your preferred IDE or through the command line.

## Additional Information

- The project uses `ConfigurationReader` to manage environment-specific details like URLs and credentials.
- Utility classes under the `utilities` package help manage browser actions, logging, and test results effectively.
- The `BaseTest` class contains setup and teardown methods to initialize and close the browser.
- Java Selenium is used for automating web interactions.
